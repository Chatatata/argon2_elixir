## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:argon2_elixir, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `argon2_elixir` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:argon2_elixir]]
    end
    ```
